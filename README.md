Hi, I'm **Lucas**, also known as **GladVillainy**.  
I am currently studying to become a **Computer Science AP**, and I plan to pursue a **Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity** afterwards.  

My main focus areas right now are building a strong foundation in coding and development.

## 🧩 Development Approach

I focus on writing clean and maintainable code by working with:

- **Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD)** —  identifying classes, designing UML diagrams, and implementing maintainable architecture
- **IIterative development** - planning, building, reviewing, and refining in short cycles
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** — writing tests early to ensure stability and predictable outcomes.
- **Structured workflow** — planning, documenting, and maintaining clarity in code and tasks.
- **Version control discipline** — meaningful commits, branching strategy, and consistent documentation.
- **AI-Assited Devlopment Approach** - debugging, review, documentation support (Javadoc), readme.

I also actively use GitHub’s tools to support my workflow:

- **Projects / Kanban board** - for task management and progress tracking  
- **Issues** - for organizing work and defining clear tasks  
- **Pull Requests** - for reviewing changes and maintaining code quality  
- **Discussions & communication** - to collaborate effectively
