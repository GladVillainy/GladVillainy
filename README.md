## Hello there my name is Lucas 👋
### Computer Science • Future Cybersecurity Bachelor • Java & SQL

Hi, I'm **Lucas**, also known as **GladVillainy**.  
I am currently studying to become a **Computer Science AP**, and I plan to pursue a **Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity** afterwards.  

My main focus areas right now are **Java**, **SQL**, and building a strong foundation in coding and development.

## 🧩 Development Approach

I focus on writing clean and maintainable code by working with:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — structure, reusability, and clear responsibility.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** — writing tests early to ensure stability and predictable outcomes.
- **Structured workflow** — planning, documenting, and maintaining clarity in code and tasks.
- **Version control discipline** — meaningful commits, branching strategy, and consistent documentation.

I also actively use GitHub’s tools to support my workflow:

- **Projects / Kanban board** for task management and progress tracking  
- **Issues** for organizing work and defining clear tasks  
- **Pull Requests** for reviewing changes and maintaining code quality  
- **Discussions & communication** to collaborate effectively
